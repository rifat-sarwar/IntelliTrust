---

## Part 1: Smart Contract Overview (5-7 minutes)

### Slide 1: Contract Architecture
"Let me start by showing you our DocumentVerification smart contract. This is built on Ethereum using Solidity and incorporates several security best practices."

**Demo Command:**
```bash
cat contracts/DocumentVerification.sol | head -30
```

**Script:**
"Here you can see our contract imports from OpenZeppelin - we're using ReentrancyGuard for security, AccessControl for role management, and Pausable for emergency controls. This ensures enterprise-grade security."

### Slide 2: Role-Based Access Control
"Security is paramount in document verification. We implement a sophisticated role-based system:"

**Demo Command:**
```bash
grep -A 5 "Role definitions" contracts/DocumentVerification.sol
```

**Script:**
"We have three distinct roles: ANCHOR_ROLE for document anchoring, REVOKE_ROLE for document revocation, and ADMIN_ROLE for contract management. This prevents unauthorized access and ensures only authorized parties can perform critical operations."

### Slide 3: Document Structure
"Each document in our system has a comprehensive structure:"

**Demo Command:**
```bash
grep -A 15 "struct Document" contracts/DocumentVerification.sol
```

**Script:**
"Notice how we track everything: user DID, timestamps, metadata, revocation status, and even document history. This creates an immutable audit trail that's crucial for legal compliance."

---

## Part 2: Live Deployment Demo (8-10 minutes)

### Step 1: Starting Local Blockchain
"Now let's deploy this contract to a local Ethereum network for demonstration."

**Demo Command:**
```bash
npx hardhat node
```

**Script:**
"This starts our local Ethereum development network. You can see it's running on localhost:8545 with 20 pre-funded accounts. This simulates a real blockchain environment for testing."

### Step 2: Contract Deployment
"Let's deploy our smart contract:"

**Demo Command:**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

**Script:**
"Watch as the contract deploys. Notice the gas estimation, deployment confirmation, and the contract address. This address is unique and will be used for all future interactions."

### Step 3: Verification Testing
"Let's verify our deployment was successful:"

**Demo Command:**
```bash
npx hardhat console --network localhost
```

**Script:**
"Now I'll connect to our deployed contract and test basic functionality. This console allows us to interact with the blockchain programmatically."

---

## Part 3: Document Verification Scenarios (10-12 minutes)

### Scenario 1: Document Anchoring
"Let's demonstrate how a document gets anchored to the blockchain."

**Demo Script:**
```javascript
// Get contract instance
const DocumentVerification = await ethers.getContractFactory("DocumentVerification");
const contract = await DocumentVerification.attach("CONTRACT_ADDRESS");

// Sample document data
const documentHash = "a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678";
const userDid = "did:example:123456789";
const metadata = '{"title":"Birth Certificate","issuer":"Government","date":"2024-01-15"}';

// Anchor document
const tx = await contract.anchorDocument(documentHash, userDid, metadata, {
    value: ethers.parseEther("0.001")
});
await tx.wait();
console.log("Document anchored successfully!");
```

**Script:**
"This transaction anchors a document hash to the blockchain. The document hash is a 64-character hexadecimal string representing the document's unique fingerprint. Once anchored, this becomes immutable and verifiable."

### Scenario 2: Document Verification
"Now let's verify this document:"

**Demo Script:**
```javascript
// Verify document
const result = await contract.verifyDocument(documentHash);
console.log("Document exists:", result[0]);
console.log("User DID:", result[1]);
console.log("Timestamp:", new Date(result[2] * 1000));
console.log("Metadata:", result[3]);
console.log("Revoked:", result[4]);
```

**Script:**
"Anyone can verify a document by calling this function. It returns the document's status, owner, timestamp, and metadata. This transparency is key to building trust in the system."

### Scenario 3: Document Revocation
"Sometimes documents need to be revoked. Let's demonstrate:"

**Demo Script:**
```javascript
// Revoke document
const revokeTx = await contract.revokeDocument(documentHash, "Document superseded by updated version");
await revokeTx.wait();
console.log("Document revoked successfully!");

// Verify revocation
const revokedResult = await contract.verifyDocument(documentHash);
console.log("Document revoked:", revokedResult[4]);
```

**Script:**
"Revocation is permanent and recorded on the blockchain. This is crucial for maintaining document integrity and preventing fraud."

---

## Part 4: Advanced Features (5-7 minutes)

### Document History
"One of our key features is complete audit trails:"

**Demo Script:**
```javascript
// Get document history
const history = await contract.getDocumentHistory(documentHash);
console.log("Document History:");
for (let i = 0; i < history[0].length; i++) {
    console.log(`- ${new Date(history[0][i] * 1000)}: ${history[1][i]} by ${history[3][i]}`);
}
```

**Script:**
"Every action on a document is recorded with timestamp, action type, and actor. This creates an immutable audit trail that's perfect for compliance and legal requirements."

### Contract Statistics
"Let's check our contract's performance metrics:"

**Demo Script:**
```javascript
// Get contract stats
const stats = await contract.getContractStats();
console.log("Total Documents:", stats[0].toString());
console.log("Total Revoked:", stats[1].toString());
console.log("Max Metadata Size:", stats[2].toString());
console.log("Min Anchoring Fee:", ethers.formatEther(stats[4]), "ETH");
```

**Script:**
"These statistics help monitor system usage and performance. They're publicly accessible, ensuring transparency."

---

## Part 5: Security Features (3-5 minutes)

### Access Control Demonstration
"Let's test our security measures:"

**Demo Script:**
```javascript
// Try to anchor document without proper role
const [deployer, user1] = await ethers.getSigners();
const userContract = contract.connect(user1);

try {
    await userContract.anchorDocument("test123", "did:test:123", "{}", {
        value: ethers.parseEther("0.001")
    });
} catch (error) {
    console.log("Security working: Unauthorized access blocked");
}
```

**Script:**
"Our role-based access control prevents unauthorized operations. Only users with the ANCHOR_ROLE can anchor documents, ensuring system integrity."

### Pause Functionality
"Emergency controls are crucial:"

**Demo Script:**
```javascript
// Pause contract
await contract.pause();
console.log("Contract paused for emergency");

// Try operation while paused
try {
    await contract.anchorDocument("test456", "did:test:456", "{}", {
        value: ethers.parseEther("0.001")
    });
} catch (error) {
    console.log("Pause working: Operations blocked during emergency");
}

// Unpause
await contract.unpause();
console.log("Contract unpaused");
```

**Script:**
"The pause functionality allows immediate response to security threats or system issues."

## Part 6: Integration Capabilities (3-5 minutes)

### Backend Integration
"Our system integrates seamlessly with traditional backend systems:"

**Demo Command:**
```bash
cd ../backend
python -c "
from services.blockchain_service import BlockchainService
service = BlockchainService()
print('Blockchain service initialized')
print('Ready for document operations')
"
```

**Script:**
"This Python service provides a clean API for backend applications to interact with our blockchain. It handles all the complexity of blockchain interactions."

### API Endpoints
"Let me show you our API endpoints:"

**Demo Command:**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/blockchain/stats" | jq
```

**Script:**
"Our REST API provides easy access to blockchain data, making it simple for frontend applications to display verification results."
